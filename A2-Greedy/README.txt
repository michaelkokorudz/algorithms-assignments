##My Approach
Data Structure: I utilized a min-heap that holds a tuple containing the triangle's valence, a unique identifier (ID), and the triangle object itself.
Efficient Access: The min-heap allows efficient access to the triangles with minimal valence when starting a new strip.
Handling Skipped Triangles: Triangles already on a strip do not need to be removed from the min-heap, as they are simply skipped upon access.
Progression: The algorithm proceeds to the next minimum valence triangle that is not part of any strip.
Valence Updates: When a triangle is added to a strip, the valence of its neighboring triangles is updated.
Heap Properties: As the valence of a triangle can only decrease, the old version is never accessed before the updated version due to the properties of the min-heap.
Time Complexity
This approach ensures a total algorithm time complexity of O(n log n).
